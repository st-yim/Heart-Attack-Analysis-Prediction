# Heart Attack Analysis and Prediction

This guided ML and data science project, conducted on Udemy, focuses on the analysis and prediction of heart attacks using a dataset. The project covers:

- **Introduction:** Understanding the project topic and recognizing variables in the dataset.
- **First Organization:** Importing essential Python libraries, loading the dataset, and conducting initial analysis.
- **Preparation for EDA:** Handling missing values, examining unique values, and categorizing variables.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Analyzing both univariate and bivariate aspects, exploring relationships and visualizing data patterns.
- **Preparation for Modeling:** Addressing outliers, dropping low-correlation columns, and performing various preprocessing steps.
- **Modeling:** Implementing machine learning algorithms such as logistic regression, decision tree, support vector machine, and random forest, with cross-validation and hyperparameter optimization.
- **Project Conclusion:** Summarizing key findings and methodologies.

This project enhances skills in data analysis, visualization, and machine learning, specifically applied to predicting heart attacks.
